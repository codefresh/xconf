[**xconf.io**](http://xconf.io) is a config file search engine.

It currently supports Dockerfiles and lets you search by any text contained in a Dockerfile on Sourcegraph, and you can click on Dockerfile instructions and base images to jump to documentation and homepages.

Try it at [**xconf.io**](http://xconf.io), and browse the code at [sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/xconf](https://sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/xconf).

It's powered by the [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com) API,
[srclib](https://srclib.org), and the
[srclib-docker](https://sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/srclib-docker)
toolchain.
